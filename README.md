# IMP-Front

The tablet app for IMP (Inventory Management Platform), built with Flutter. It talks to the backend in [IMP-Back](https://github.com/lulixs/IMP-Back).

**Status:** first-time setup and the dashboard are built. The dashboard shows one sample category until it is connected to `GET /api/dashboard`. Nothing is saved to the backend yet.

## Setup (once per computer)

1. Install Flutter (stable channel). Check it with `flutter doctor`.
2. Clone the repo and fetch the packages:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:lulixs/IMP-Front.git
   cd IMP-Front
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Running the app

```
flutter run -d chrome                     # normal start, with first-time setup
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/dev.dart     # skips setup and opens the dashboard
```

`lib/dev.dart` is for debugging only. Release builds always start from `lib/main.dart`, which runs first-time setup.

While the app is running, press `r` to reload your changes, `R` to restart, and `q` to quit.

## Checks

Run both before committing:

```
flutter analyze    # should say: No issues found!
flutter test       # should say: All tests passed!
```

## Project layout

```
lib/
├── main.dart              starts the app with first-time setup
├── dev.dart               starts the app on the dashboard (debugging only)
├── theme.dart             colors and text field style
├── models/                data classes for API responses, with fromJson
├── screens/
│   ├── setup/             first-time setup: Master account, tablet name, first employee, confirmation
│   └── dashboard/         dashboard page, category cards, and the sample data
└── widgets/common.dart    small pieces shared by every screen
test/                      one test file per screen or model
prototype/                 the old click-through app, kept as a guide for style and layout
```

## API contracts

The shape of each API response is defined in the backend repo under `docs/api/`, for example `docs/api/dashboard.md`. If a shape needs to change, change that file first, then the code on both sides.
